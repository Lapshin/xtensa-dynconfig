This GCC plugin configures xtensa-gcc for the specific xtensa CPU. It will
only load into gcc version that supports such dynamic configuration.
Without this plugin gcc will produce code for the default xtensa core: the
FSF one, or for the core configured with the xtensa configuration overlay.

Building:

To build this plugin you need xtensa-gcc with plugins directory installed
and the host gcc. Install configuration overlay for the target xtensa core
into the directory named <config-name> and run make CONFIG=<config-name>
in the current directory. xtensa-gcc must be in the PATH.

Using:

Invoke xtensa-gcc with additional parameter

  -fplugin=<full-path-to>/xtensa-gcc-config-<config-name>.so
